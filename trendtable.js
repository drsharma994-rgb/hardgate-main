HARDGATE — trendtable.js
TREND MATRIX tab (id 'trendmx'): multi-timeframe trend dashboard across the
full combined universe (Delta + CoinDCX + Binance extension via xuniverse.js,
≥ $5M turnover floor, no top-N cap; Binance-only fallback when xu absent).

Per symbol: binanceKlines 1d x260 + 4h x120 -> five signed components
(-1/0/+1), composite score -5..+5:
  1D TREND   1d close vs ema200
  CROSS      1d ema50 vs ema200, plus fresh-cross marker (<=10 bars):
             GOLDEN (crossOver) / DEATH (crossUnder)
  4H CASCADE 4h ema9 > ema21 > ema50 full align +1 / full inverse -1 / else 0
  CLOUD      ichimokuState(1d).priceVsCloud: ABOVE +1 / BELOW -1 / INSIDE 0
  ADX        adx(1d,14) latest >= 25 -> +sign(sum of the four trend
             components) as a strength point, else 0

Classic script, no build step. Loaded AFTER indicators.js, indicators2.js
and binance.js. Exposes the pure classifier window.trendScore, the pure
level builder window.trendmxPlan (+ trendmxPlanHTML/trendmxPlanBlock
renderers) and the window.HG_tabs registration (id/label/mount/refresh —
refresh re-runs a previously-started scan, busy-guarded, skipping honestly
when the operator never ran one). Never throws at load time;
all network goes through binance.js (10s AbortController, 60s cache);
per-symbol failures are counted and skipped; bulk fetches are paced in
chunks of 5.
