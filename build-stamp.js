  pack: 'THE GOLD SWING LIVE BLOCKS REPRODUCE THEIR OWN HEADLINE, SO hg-v961 MEASURED THE WRONG THING - AND THIS CORRECTS MY OWN PACK. hg-v916 gave every SCALP row a live block because the scalp headline is the whole 2,193-trade replay and the desk forms 1,205 of it: a real subset, and the gap is the point. hg-v961 gave the SWING rows a live block and described it the same way. It is not the same thing. On ALL FOURTEEN swing rows the live block reproduces the headline to the headline own precision, because the swing headline was ALREADY derived from backtest-goldswing-results.json before hg-v961 touched it - proved by booting the pre-hg-v961 tree, 14 of 14 identical. So what hg-v961 actually delivered was regeneration and provenance, not a population correction, and its three removals asserted at zero were the SCALP desk gates (cost bar, 1.5xATR stop floor, suppress), none of which is the swing desk. WHAT THE SWING DESK DOES THAT THE WALK DOES NOT IS IN THE ARTIFACT OWN METADATA, quoted rather than asserted here: hgFilterGoldPostGate, the weekend demotes, and the best-levels / formation ticket batch - and hgApplyGoldBestLevels REWRITES entry, stop and T1 on every live swing ticket. Those three numbers decide whether a trade fills, where it stops and what it wins. Every swing edge verdict is therefore measured on a PRE-FORMATION book, and the population the desk forms is unmeasured. THE CARD STOPS CLAIMING A FILTER THAT NEVER RAN: the note read on the N trades the desk STILL FORMS over a population nothing was removed from, with a parenthetical about rows gated out. It now says there is no separate live population, that what the desk forms is unmeasured, and NAMES the best-levels pass as the reason - the difference between an honest gap and a shrug. The SCALP note is untouched where the subset is real. hgGoldEdgeLiveIsHeadline and hgGoldEdgeLiveScope make the duplication reportable instead of assumed: swing 14 duplicates and ZERO independent, scalp 22 independent, 3 duplicate, 2 suppressed-none, and the buckets partition each table. An unreadable table reports null, never a clean partition. THE OBVIOUS FIX IS MEASURED AND REFUSED: scoping the walk to the tab own R:R floor flips two rows net sign - ob on n=4 to 3, and p8range on n=40 to 34, which would turn a neutral row that can lead into a demote - and it is refused because the walk computes rr on the inline engine levels while the floor is applied by the pass that REPLACES them. Filtering a pre-snap ratio by a post-snap floor is a second wrong population, not a correction. NO VERDICT MOVES. The panel BRANCHES on the verdict so a future bake that can replay the formation pass announces itself instead of hiding behind today refusal, and renders nothing without the literal. A THIRD FINDING, A DOCUMENTED GATE THAT DOES NOT EXIST: AGENTS.md said swing formation enforces 2.0R via HG_GOLD_SWING_MIN_RR. The file says 1.5 and git log -S finds no commit where it was ever 2 - and that false number sent the first cut of this pack measuring against 2.0R and reporting 72.8% where the honest figure is 10.2%. The generator READS the floor from gold-best-levels.js and is fatal without it, the guard drives it against a tree declaring a different floor so a retyped copy cannot follow, and it now holds AGENTS.md to the source. FOUR DEFECTS IN THIS PACK OWN WORK, ALL CAUGHT BY ITS OWN MUTATION PASS: the identity predicate first RE-ROUNDED the live figure, which sends 0.2415 to 0.242 and calls a row that is the same number independent - it is a tolerance at the headline precision, and the boundary case that proves it had to be 0.2155, because 0.2154 and 0.2145 both re-round back onto 0.215 and cannot tell the two rules apart; the flip rule reads NET and on this walk gross flips the same two rows, so that mutation was EQUIVALENT here and is now proved on a synthetic artifact where gross stays positive while net crosses; the main-module check was a filename SUFFIX test and this guard own name ends with the same suffix, so importing the module ran the whole CLI report into the test output - fixed by comparing resolved paths, and the probe that proves it is deliberately NAMED to reproduce it; and the desk-wiring assertion was grep-satisfiable, passing while the call was deleted from the banner because the name survives on the lookup line above, so it is bounded to the banner assignment. Nothing is re-baked here - every data route is 403 CONNECT - and the committed tree round-trips to zero drift. NO GATE, THRESHOLD OR VERDICT MOVES ON ANY DESK, and no setup leaves any board.

/* hg-v958: THE FRESHNESS CHECK HAD NO CLOCK.

   hgBuildInit ran hgBuildFreshness() once at DOMContentLoaded - the one
   moment a tab is current by definition - and after that only when the tab
   was hidden and shown again. This desk is built to sit open all day as the
   FOREGROUND tab (HG_GLOBAL_SCAN_MS re-scans it every ten minutes without
   ever hiding it), so visibilitychange never fires and the question "what is
   the server serving?" was asked exactly once per tab, at boot.

   Measured by driving the real file: zero timers installed, one fetch at
   boot, none in the eight hours after, and a second only after a tab switch.
   That is the hg-v957 defect in the OTHER update path - and it is why this
   path, which has no lockout bug of its own, still never recovered a pinned
   tab. Five minutes, deliberately the fastest of the three clocks (SW update
   15 min, desk re-scan 10 min), because it is one small GET of one file and
   it is the path that can recover a tab whose service worker is wedged. */
