  pack: 'THE LAST FOUR GOLD DESKS GET THE NEWS GATE, THE COVERAGE REPORTER REACHES ZERO UNCOVERED, AND GOLD SCALP RUNS ON A 3-MINUTE CLOCK. hg-v963 built a reporter so gaps would name themselves and it named SEVEN. hg-v964 wired the three desks that record a conditionally true ticket and took it to four. This takes it to ZERO: OPTI GOLD, 80PERCENT, GOLD (inline) and TAURIC each have a route now, and that bucket is empty for the first time since the reporter existed. NO NEW POLICY IS INVENTED PER DESK. Each treats the news lock EXACTLY as it already treats the weekend, because the two calendars make the same claim about the same instant - that new gold minting is barred - and inventing a second answer per desk is how four desks end up with four policies nobody can state. OPTI GOLD withholds the ACTIONABLE claim and keeps ENTRY, STOP and T1 (hg-v950). The inline GOLD lanes withhold BOTH handoffs (hg-v951). 80PERCENT and TAURIC mark and withhold nothing (hg-v950 and hg-v952), because their rows record no ticket there is anything to withhold. ZERO NEW WRAPPERS, and that is the shape of it: those three files carry a BYTE-IDENTICAL weekend wrapper each, so three matching news wrappers beside them would be SIX copies of one rule, which hg-v949 calls a second rule rather than a second copy. So the null-unless-it-locks rule lives ONCE, as hgGoldNewsMark, delegating to hg-v964 hgGoldNewsVerdict and adding no calendar, no threshold and no seam of its own; every call site is a typeof guard and nothing else, so there is no rule in them to drift. EVERY DESK READS BOTH CALENDARS ON THE SAME INSTANT EXPRESSION, which is the drift hg-v952 and hg-v963 each paid for once. The inline GOLD lanes go further and read the bar ONCE per lane, because the 4h swing and 15m scalp lanes genuinely judge different moments and one shared instant would mislabel one of them (hg-v950). TAURIC bar was computed inline inside its record writer and is now one function serving the record and the card. The two withhold notices are SEPARATE functions on purpose: a weekend and a news lock say different things about why a bar is not tradeable, and one message for two causes is the hg-v940 defect. WHAT TAURIC DELIBERATELY DOES NOT GET: the mark is on its card, not in its forward record. A new ledger field needs the three hg-v955 seams and a reader, and a field nothing reads is ornamental - that is hg-v955 own finding, and half-wiring it here would reproduce it. GOLD SCALP NOW REFRESHES EVERY 3 MINUTES, asked for directly, and the global sweep is untouched. WHAT THAT ACTUALLY BUYS, said rather than implied: this desk mints on 15m bars, so a 3-minute cycle brings a new closed bar on roughly one scan in five. What moves on the other four is the LIVE half - the spread lock, the live mark, DEAD-ON-ARRIVAL, the conviction evaluation and the hg-v930 one-at-a-time hold - the half that decides whether a card already on screen is still tradeable. Claiming five times the setups would be false; five times the RE-CHECKS is what this is. The bars are genuinely re-fetched, because hgCandleCacheTtl returns 60s on this foreground path. It needs no lock of its own: goldscalpRefresh self-guards on __scan.busy and returns busy, so a tick landing on the global sweep or a manual RUN cannot double-scan. ONE PAGE, ONE CLOCK (hg-v958): a second init installs no second timer, and it fails open at every seam without the timer dying. A STALE CLAIM IN AGENTS.md, found while adding that clock: the hg-v441 entry said HG_AUTO_REFRESH_HARDCODED_MS equalled HG_GLOBAL_SCAN_MS, that the header showed AUTO 10m, and that the 2m / 3m / 5m clicks were ignored. hg-v656 set that constant to 0, unlocking the selector, and never corrected the entry - so for eight packs the file documented a lock the source had already removed. THREE DEFECTS IN MY OWN WORK, all caught by this pack own mutation pass: an assertion used the COERCING isFinite, and isFinite(null) is TRUE because +null is 0, so a mutation nulling all three levels survived it - the same trap this codebase has now hit seven times, here inside the assertion meant to catch it; the lane stub IGNORED its argument, so a lane could hand the news calendar the OTHER lane series and everything still passed, which is the hg-v964 gap of testing the rule and not that the desk calls it with the right thing; and the lifted block STOPPED just above the boot call, so deleting the line that arms the clock was invisible. AND TWO STALE EXPECTATIONS IN EARLIER GUARDS: both hg-v963 and hg-v964 required the uncovered bucket to be NON-EMPTY, and emptying it turned them red with nothing wrong. Both now MAKE a gap and require the reporter to name it, rather than depending on one being left behind. NO GATE IS LOOSENED, no threshold moves, and no setup leaves any board that was not already leaving it. Tests: tests/test-gold-news-raw-minters.mjs, 109 assertions, with 32 of 32 behavioural mutations caught across gold-formation.js, optigold.js, eightypercent.js, tauric.js and index.html, baseline verified green before every pass',

/* hg-v958: THE FRESHNESS CHECK HAD NO CLOCK.

   hgBuildInit ran hgBuildFreshness() once at DOMContentLoaded - the one
   moment a tab is current by definition - and after that only when the tab
   was hidden and shown again. This desk is built to sit open all day as the
   FOREGROUND tab (HG_GLOBAL_SCAN_MS re-scans it every ten minutes without
   ever hiding it), so visibilitychange never fires and the question "what is
   the server serving?" was asked exactly once per tab, at boot.

   Measured by driving the real file: zero timers installed, one fetch at
   boot, none in the eight hours after, and a second only after a tab switch.
   That is the hg-v957 defect in the OTHER update path - and it is why this
   path, which has no lockout bug of its own, still never recovered a pinned
   tab. Five minutes, deliberately the fastest of the three clocks (SW update
   15 min, desk re-scan 10 min), because it is one small GET of one file and
   it is the path that can recover a tab whose service worker is wedged. */
