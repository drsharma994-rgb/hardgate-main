  pack: 'THE GOLD NEWS GATE WAS NOT MISSING ON THE OTHER DESKS - IT WAS DEFEATED BY A LITERAL. hgGoldNewsGate has locked new gold minting 30 min before and 15 min after CPI / NFP / FOMC / GDP since hg-v554, it is reached inside hgGoldInstFilter, and it WORKS: driven on a real snapshot it locks at -10 min and +10 min around a CPI instant and releases by +3h. GOLD ULTRA at TWO call sites and GOLD DIRECTION at THREE called that gated mint and handed it a literal news: null. On null the gate returns lock false with unchecked true - FAIL-OPEN BY CONSTRUCTION, every scan, forever - and the snapshot they needed is a global, window.hgNewsState, that their sibling SUPER GOLD already reads. So nothing was unavailable and nothing was hard; five literals disabled the one gate on this desk list that answers to the events that actually move gold. THE INSTANT WAS WRONG TOO: both desks passed the WALL CLOCK, so a scan re-run after a release dated the lock wrong in both directions - the hg-v952 SUPER GOLD defect in a third place. Each lane now reads ITS OWN signal bar, 15m for scalp and 4h for swing, because one shared instant would mislabel one of them (hg-v950 per-shape rule), and the guard proves the two lanes get different instants from their own series. THE RULE LIVES ONCE, in gold-formation.js beside the weekend calendar, and DELEGATES to hgGoldNewsGate rather than re-deciding what a tier-1 event is - with goldind absent there is NO verdict rather than a second copy of a news calendar. It fails OPEN at every seam: no instant, an unreadable one, a negative one, EPOCH ZERO, no snapshot, or a snapshot the gate itself reads as unchecked, and there is no verdict and nothing is withheld, because a gate the desk cannot read is not a reason to withhold a setup. The unchecked case is the one the news null defect actually produced and it is asserted separately, because a mutation treating it as not-locked survived the first pass. A COVERAGE REPORTER, DERIVED NOT TYPED: the desk list comes from HG_GOLD_WEEKEND_MINTERS, the repo one census of gold desks that mint, because hg-v954 established that a hand-kept second copy inside a reporter is exactly what goes stale - it had gone stale twice by then. The partition is checked against the census count the reporter itself saw rather than a number typed in the guard, after the first cut hardcoded 15 against a census of 14. It VERIFIES behaviourally: the probe hands the shared verdict an instant inside a tier-1 window and one outside and requires the two to differ, so a route that never locks and one that always locks both read BROKEN. SEVEN DESKS REPORT UNCOVERED and the reporter names them rather than my memory: NEW GOLD, OMNIGOLD 1, OPTI GOLD, GOLD PRO, 80PERCENT, GOLD inline and TAURIC - more than the four I predicted from the raw-bar minters. They are REPORTED and deliberately NOT wired: withholding on a desk that never had the read changes what leaves the board, and this pack fixes what is broken before widening. FIVE GREP-SATISFIABLE ASSERTIONS IN MY OWN GUARD, all caught by its own mutation pass: counting the name hgGoldNewsSnapshot is satisfied by the gfn lookup line alone, so deleting the assignment below it survived, and so did reverting the instant to the wall clock and dropping the signal-bar read - three on GOLD ULTRA and two on GOLD DIRECTION. Both blocks are now LIFTED OUT OF THE FILE AND EXECUTED under stubs (the hg-v951 technique) and the values read back. Nothing is re-baked here - every data route is 403 CONNECT. NO GATE IS LOOSENED, no threshold moves, and no setup leaves any board that was not already leaving it: what changes is that two desks now ASK the gate instead of answering for it. Tests: tests/test-gold-news-gate-wire.mjs, 77 assertions, 19 of 19 behavioural mutations caught across gold-formation.js, goldultra.js and golddirection.js, baseline verified green before every pass',

/* hg-v958: THE FRESHNESS CHECK HAD NO CLOCK.

   hgBuildInit ran hgBuildFreshness() once at DOMContentLoaded - the one
   moment a tab is current by definition - and after that only when the tab
   was hidden and shown again. This desk is built to sit open all day as the
   FOREGROUND tab (HG_GLOBAL_SCAN_MS re-scans it every ten minutes without
   ever hiding it), so visibilitychange never fires and the question "what is
   the server serving?" was asked exactly once per tab, at boot.

   Measured by driving the real file: zero timers installed, one fetch at
   boot, none in the eight hours after, and a second only after a tab switch.
   That is the hg-v957 defect in the OTHER update path - and it is why this
   path, which has no lockout bug of its own, still never recovered a pinned
   tab. Five minutes, deliberately the fastest of the three clocks (SW update
   15 min, desk re-scan 10 min), because it is one small GET of one file and
   it is the path that can recover a tab whose service worker is wedged. */
